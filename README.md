- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ada!
- Iâ€™m relatively new to coding seriously, but it's something I've been wanting to learn and practive with for a good while now!
- Iâ€™m currently learning basic Python, and a little bit of Ruby on the side. Also hoping to get into Ada Dev Academy (yes, same namesake. It's a coincidence.).
- I love games, and at some point I'd like to make one.
- You can reach me at @at-fieIds on twitter! (i replacing the L)
